	The theme of this project is a popular treasure hunt game in which the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate does. I will be implanting the part of the game that represents the intelligent agent, which is a pirate in this case. The pirate will try to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning
	
	The first class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix.
	 
	The second class, GameExperience.py, stores the episodes â€“ that is, all the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state. This is later used by the agent for learning by experience, called \"exploration\".

 
   	What matter is that this kind of assignment help solve complex problem using AI, that would take human more time and a lot of mathematic to solve it. That what make the AI so valuable, it makes life easier to solve proble quickly,  optimize solutions to a lot of real-world problem,  reduce the amount of time it would take to complete a single task.
	The best way to approach AI problem is to analyze it first, understand the big picture of the problem, then find a way to break it down to small chuck and then try to solve it by one step at the time.
